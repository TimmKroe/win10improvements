# Windows 10 Improvements

This is my collection of scripts I run of any fresh Windows 10 Instance.

## What does it do?
- removes Bloatware
- removes Cortana
- removes Telemetry
- unpins all Apps from Startmenu
- Installs Software
- Optimizes Windows Updates
- Disables Edge PDF
- Disables Shake Minimize
- Enables File Explorer tweaks

## How to use it?
1. Download the latest Release
2. Put the [Chocolatey Packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages) into the .mysoftware file
3. Execute the `general.ps1` file
4. Watch how it goes
